===========================

This is a plugin meant to be used with your Prerender server to cache responses to File System.

Run this from within your Prerender server directory:

$ npm install prerender-fs-cache --save
```
##### server.js
```js
const prerender = require('prerender');
const server = prerender();

server.use(require('prerender-fs-cache'))

server.start();
```
##### Test it:
```bash
